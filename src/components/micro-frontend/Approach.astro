      <h2>Initial Assessment and Planning</h2>
      <p>
        We start by analyzing your current application structure and identifying areas where micro-frontends can add the
        most value. This assessment helps us create a tailored implementation plan.

      <h2>Modularization of Components</h2>
      <p>
        We break down your frontend into smaller, independent components, each responsible for a specific part of the
        user interface. This modularization makes it easier to manage and scale the application.

      <h2>Technology Selection</h2>
      <p>
        We help you choose the best tools and frameworks for each component, ensuring that your micro-frontends are
        built using the most suitable technologies for their specific functions.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article class="block">
      <h2>Integration Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        We establish a seamless integration process that allows the individual micro-frontends to work together
        harmoniously, ensuring a cohesive user experience across the entire application.

      <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        Each micro-frontend is optimized for performance, with a focus on minimizing load times and ensuring smooth
        interactions. This step ensures that the overall application remains fast and responsive.
