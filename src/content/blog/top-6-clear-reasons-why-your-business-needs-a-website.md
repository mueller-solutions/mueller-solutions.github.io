In today’s digital world, it’s not about whether your small business should have a website. The real question is, can you afford not to? Websites are no longer a luxury for small businesses—they’re a must. Having a website gives your business important advantages to help you grow and stay competitive.

## Why Every Small Business Needs a Website

When you’re looking to buy something new or learn about a service, where do you go? Every day, billions of people use the internet to search for products and services. That’s why it’s so important for businesses to be online. A survey by Clutch shows that 64% of small businesses already have a website, and this number is likely to grow as more businesses see how important it is to be online.

A well-designed website boosts your business’s credibility. It shows potential customers that you’re professional and gives them easy access to all the information they need about your products or services.

## Top 6 Reasons Why Your Business Must Need a Website

With social media being so popular, you might wonder, “Do I really need a website?” The answer is yes, and I’m here to explain why.

In 2024, 80-90% of people researched companies online before visiting or making a purchase, and small businesses without a website risked losing the same percentage of customers. When the world shifted to needing more online presence than in-person interactions the next year, having your own website became even more essential.

Still not sure if a website is right for you? If you’re curious about how a website can offer more than just a social media profile, keep reading! Here are six top reasons why having a website is a must in 2024.

### A Website Makes Your Business Look Professional and Builds Trust

Most people don’t trust a business that doesn’t have a good website. A clean, modern site that is updated regularly and appears in search engines makes you look more credible. Potential customers will trust you more when they can find all the information, they need in one place. In today’s digital world, we expect businesses to have an online presence.

Even the smallest local business or organization needs a website. Whether it’s a simple one-page site for a small shop or a full website for a local church, having an online presence is important.

Anyone can quickly set up a Facebook page or an Instagram account with fake information, making their profile look just like yours. However, a professional business website gives your company real legitimacy in a way that social media can’t match.

If you don’t have a business but want a place to showcase your portfolio or highlight your work for recruiters when job hunting, a personal website is the best way to stand out professionally.

### People Search for Your Business Online

Imagine two friends, James and Robert, sitting together for coffee and chatting. James tells Robert about your business, sharing his great experience and recommending he visit. Later, when Mueller gets home, he decides to look up your business online to learn more.

When Mueller searches for your company online, he can’t find a website. Even though he trusts his friend Alamin, he’s hesitant because there’s no site to learn more about your business. This is what happens to companies that don’t have a website.

You need a website for your business because people search for it online. Whether someone hears about you from a friend or drives by your location, they’ll want to look up your company to learn more. Without a website, potential customers can’t find important information, and as a result, they may not visit your store.

Here’s another important fact: 93% of online experiences begin with a search engine. Most people start by searching online. To make sure these searchers find your business in the results, you need a website that can guide potential customers to your company.

### A Business Website Can Help You Attract More Customers and Increase Sales

Well-optimized websites can show up on the first page of Google searches, bringing in new customers who might not have been looking for you directly but are exploring a topic. People are more likely to “stumble upon” your website than your social media profile. Also, it’s easier for customers to compare you with competitors when everyone has a professional website.

If you invest in Google Ads or Facebook Ads, you can send traffic directly to your website. On your site, potential customers will find all the information they need to make a decision, along with a call-to-action to encourage them to buy. Pages that include popup forms and web push notifications help keep visitors engaged and encourage them to return.

Adding contact forms and live chat to your website makes it easier for customers to reach you. A website is available 24/7, every day of the year, from anywhere in the world. This keeps your business in customers’ minds even after hours. Websites expand your reach and promote your business without stopping.

### People Use Your Website to Engage With Your Business

If you’re still wondering, “Do I need a website for my business?” here’s another great reason to invest: Engagement. Engagement is key to turning leads into long-term customers. Over 63% of consumers use a company’s website to connect with the brand.

In today’s digital world, building a strong online presence is essential to engage potential customers and turn them into clients. Without a website, you miss important chances to convert leads. A clear, informative, and visually appealing website can help your business attract prospects, impress them, and turn them into loyal customers.

### A Website Gives you complete control over your platform

This reason has two parts. First, a website gives you the freedom to express yourself. You can’t customize your social media presence as much because everything has to follow the same format as everyone else’s. If you truly want to stand out, a website is the way to go.

Having complete design freedom allows you to showcase your brand in a unique way, highlighting its voice and personality. Control over your webpage isn’t just about graphics and layout; you get to choose what to include. So if you have great online reviews, customer testimonials, videos, or anything else, you can feature them all on your site.

If you have a gallery or portfolio, a website gives you the chance to showcase it creatively. You can redesign and change anything on your website whenever you want.

Using pre-made website templates gives you design options while maintaining full control over your site. Your website is your own space, so you don’t have to follow the constantly changing rules of social media platforms. Unlike those platforms, which can fade away, your website can be a lasting presence. Plus, any internet user can visit your website without needing to create an account.

At [MUELLER Solutions](https://mueller-solutions.dev), we create websites with custom code. This makes your website really fast and lets you design it just the way you want.

### Websites Are The Foundation of your marketing strategy

A website is often the first place potential customers go to learn about your business. It can also be where they end up when they’re ready to make a purchase, after clicking on an email, a Facebook ad, or an Instagram post. Some might visit your site just to sign up for your emails.

Someone driving by your business might click the pin on Google Maps, which takes them to your website to check prices or your menu. They could also type your website URL into their browser from a business card. Or, after watching your YouTube video, they might “click the link below” to get a coupon code for your new online course.

All your marketing efforts, whether your business is online or offline, should start with and point back to your own impressive and informative website.

Campaigns are easier to manage when everything is connected, with the website as the central point. That’s why having a website is a top priority and the first step toward success.

## A Well-Designed Website Helps to Unlock Business Success

Having a website is definitely worth it for small businesses. A good website increases your visibility, helps you reach more people, boosts sales through online shopping, and helps build customer relationships. While it takes time and money to set up, the potential benefits make it a smart investment.

Remember, not having a website means missing out on opportunities. So, if you’re still unsure whether a website is worth it for your small business, the answer is a definite yes!
