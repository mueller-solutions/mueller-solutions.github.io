excerpt: >-
  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the
  language, enabling developers to catch errors early in the development process
  and write more robust, maintainable code. Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript
  enhances JavaScript with features like type annotations, interfaces, and
  advanced tooling support, making it easier to build large-scale applications.
  It compiles down to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with existing
  JavaScript code and any environment where JavaScript runs. TypeScript is
  widely adopted in modern web development, particularly for projects that
  require scalability and reliability.
