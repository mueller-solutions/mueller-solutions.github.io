excerpt: >-
  PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language designed for web
  development. It is especially well-suited for creating dynamic and interactive
  websites. PHP is embedded within HTML, allowing developers to generate
  content, manage databases, and handle server-side tasks with ease. It powers
  many popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, making it a key
  technology for building everything from small personal blogs to large-scale
  web applications. Known for its flexibility and broad support across hosting
  environments, PHP continues to be a foundational language for web development.
