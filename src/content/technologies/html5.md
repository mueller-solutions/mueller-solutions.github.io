  HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the
  standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It
  introduces new elements and attributes that enhance the capabilities of web
  pages, making them more interactive and multimedia-rich without the need for
  additional plugins. HTML5 supports video, audio, graphics, and more complex
  interactions, improving the user experience across different devices and
  platforms. It also provides better semantics, allowing developers to create
  more accessible and SEO-friendly web content. HTML5 is the foundation for
  modern web development, enabling the creation of responsive and dynamic
  websites.
