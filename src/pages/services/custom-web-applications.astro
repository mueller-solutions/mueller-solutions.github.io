          What is custom web application development, and how is it different from off-the-shelf solutions?
        </h3>
        <p class="body1">
          The end product can never be compared directly with off-the-shelf software developed for a wide market since
          custom web applications are engineered strictly using your specific workflows, features, and branding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="card white shadow fade-from-bottom">
        <h3 class="heading3">How much does it cost to develop a custom web application?</h3>
        <p class="body1">
          We give a clear quote after the discovery phase, which we believe helps this cost align with the value and
          functionality delivered by the application.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="card white shadow fade-from-bottom">
        <h3 class="heading3">How do you ensure the security of my custom web application?</h3>
        <p class="body1">
          Security is always a priority in the development of every custom web application we develop. This best
          practice will be adhered to in terms of secure coding, data encryption, and user authentication.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="card white shadow fade-from-bottom">
        <h3 class="heading3">What happens after my custom web application is launched?</h3>
        <p class="body1">
          After the launch of your web app, we keep providing ongoing support and maintenance so that it continues to
          operate at optimum levels.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class="card white shadow fade-from-bottom">
        <h3 class="heading3">
          Can you integrate my custom web application with existing systems or third-party services?
        </h3>
        <p class="body1">
          Yes! Our team is knowledgeable in the integration of custom web applications into any existing business
          systems, such as CRMs, ERPs, payment gateways, and other third-party services.
