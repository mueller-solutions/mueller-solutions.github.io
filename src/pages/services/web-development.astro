    question: 'What is custom web development, and how is it different from using a website builder?',
    answer:
      'While other builders develop pages from a set of pre-designed templates with few customization options, custom web development implies the actual coding from scratch or through frameworks that permit complete flexibility and scalability.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to develop a custom website?',
    answer:
      'The timeline depends on the complexity of the project. Factors that determine this could be the features that are to be covered, how complicated the design should be, what kind of content requirements are needed, or third-party service integrations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does custom web development cost?',
    answer:
      'Key factors driving costs in the number of pages, functionality (e-commerce, user portals, custom forms), the technology stack, and design requirements.',
  },
  {
    question: "Can I update my website after it's developed?",
    answer:
      'Yep! A custom site can also be built with a Content Management System, such as WordPress, or even with a custom back-end solution where you can easily update your site.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will my custom website be mobile-friendly?',
    answer:
      "That's right. So, if all of the custom sites that we develop are going to auto-respond to various screen sizes and device types.",
